    Big Cable is getting desperate. Now that the FCC is moving forward with our
    plan for <u>real</u> net neutrality using Title II, they're spending millions of
    dollars on false and misleading advertising, and top-price political lobbyists,
    all in a last-ditch attempt to scare the public and lawmakers into killing
    net neutrality.

    Big Cable's lobbyists have been working tirelessly to poison the public
    debate with lies and propaganda, trying to scare citizens and lawmakers
    into abandoning net neutrality.
    But we can fight back!
