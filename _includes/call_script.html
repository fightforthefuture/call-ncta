    "Hi, my name is ______. I'm calling to ask your company to stop spending
    millions of dollars on political contributions and misleading 
    advertisements. The American people won’t be fooled by lies, and we won’t
    settle for anything less than real net neutrality using Title II of the
    Telecommunications Act."
