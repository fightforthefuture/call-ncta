Call the FCC Script
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, I'm Jeff Lyon from CallTheFCC. In a moment, we'll connect you to an FCC
employee. If you'd like, we can call you back every day around this time so you
can keep calling other FCC employees and asking for their help. 

Being a daily caller is completely optional and you can stop at any
time. But with enough daily callers, our voices will be impossible to ignore.

To make a single call to the FCC right now, press star. To become a daily
caller, press one.

* Thanks! We'll call you back around this same time tomorrow. You can stop
  receiving these calls at any time by following the in-call menu or emailing
  support@callthefcc.com

Alright! We're connecting you to the FCC. When they answer, say you're calling because you agree with President Obama that the FCC needs to pass strong net neutrality rules under Title II — and it should do so this year.  Any delay hurts the cause of Net Neutrality, benefits the big cable companies that want to undermine it, and would be a betrayal of the millions who’ve spoken out.  Ask them to do anything in their power to support Net Neutrality.
